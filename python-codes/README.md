# Selected Codes From My "Introduction to Data Analysis for Social Sciences" Course
For this course, I did many Python projects as lab assignments. In the following section, you can find information about some of the lab assignments I have made and you can take a look at the codes themselves.
## Lab 9 Code
> [!NOTE]
> Analysed a mock-up set of customer data of over eleven thousand customers to pinpoint important marketing information based on age groups, income, education and marital status

For this assignment, the teachers provided us with a mock Excel datasheet with the following information as columns (with the names of the columns in parentheses):

- Participant ID (id)
- Birth Year (birth_year)
- Education Level (education)
- Marital Status (marital_status)
- Income Level (income)
- Registration Date (reg_date)
- Number of purchases on the online store (web_purchases)
- Number of purchases at physical stores (store_purchases)

With this dataset, we were asked to answer a few marketing questions by writing a Python code that analyzed certain parameters.

You can investigate the code [here](python-codes/lab9_comment.py).

## Lab 10 Code

> [!NOTE]
> Plotted and visualised a mock-up dataset about song releases based on markers such as duration, danceability and energy to compare and contrast information about certain trends in genres

For this assignment, the teachers provided us with a mock Excel datasheet with the following information as columns (with the names of the columns in parentheses):

- Name of the track artist (artist_name)
- Name of the track (track_name)
- Popularity of the track (popularity)
- Danceability of the track (danceability)
- Track duration (duration)
- Track energy (energy)
- Track genre (music_genre)

With this dataset, we were asked to create graph visualisations using the parameters provided to us.
